<p>I prefer to receive feedback: (face to face or in writing or other) I prefer to recive feedback in person</p>
<p>If you are going to correct me: (do it privately or do it in front of the class or other)Please do it privatley</p>
<p>If you are going to tell me I'm doing something wrong, phrase it this way:You arnet exactly getting this let me help you</p>
<p>If you want to praise me: (do it privately or do it in front of the class or other) Infront of the class or in private works i dont really mind which one</p>
